- Run `python drawer.py <image_path>`
  - Confirm processed image in the popup window, close it to continue
  - After 5 seconds, the program will start drawing 

## Feature

- `scale`

  Set scale of drawing
- `draw_position_point` (new!)

  Draw the four corners of the picture to prevent misoperation caused by high-frequency automatic clicks

  I believe you wouldn't want it to frantically click on your taskbar applications and then stage such a scene:

  <img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/27/qsk2YL19ZmuSbrP.jpg" alt="ðŸ¤£ðŸ‘‰" width="30%">
- `interlaced` (new!)

  ðŸ¤£ðŸ‘‰The actual test results show that there is almost no difference between interlaced scanning and progressive scanning in terms of time and GPU utilization.
